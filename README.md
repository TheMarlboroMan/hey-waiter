A table-waiting game.

# TODO:

- Placeholder Graphics and sprite tables
	- Player

		per player orientation!

- Design table states so they can be understood:
	- Customer arriving (an arrow when out of the screen!!!!)
	- Customer calling (with timer!)
	- Customer waiting (with timer!)
	- Customer eating
	- Customer leaving

- Definitive graphics for
	- Bar
	- Table
	- Trash
	- Player
	- Customers
	- HUD consumables
	- Consumables in player tray and table
- Add music
