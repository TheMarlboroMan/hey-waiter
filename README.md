# hey-waiter

A table-waiting game.

# TODO:

- Check what is happening with the order of table and player, looks weird.

- Design table states so they can be understood:
	- Customer arriving (an arrow when out of the screen!!!!)
		No words, very important, just an arrow with exclamation points, for example!
	- When the customer arrives, it should come into the table.
	- Customer calling 
		- Exclamation bubble?? 
	 	- with timer!
	- Customer waiting 
		- clock thinking bubble
		- with timer!
	- Customer eating
	- Customer leaving
	- Consumables in bubble, to know what the customer is asking for!!!
	- Dirty table.

- Placeholder Graphics and sprite tables
	- Player
		- Carrying food, maybe separate sprites
		- Carrying trash! Definitely a separate sprite.
	- Customers
	- Consumables in player tray and table
		- This is gonna be VERY interesting, we'd need a set of coordinates
		per player orientation!

- Definitive graphics for
	- Bar
	- Table
	- Trash
	- Player
	- Customers
	- HUD consumables
	- Consumables in player tray and table

- Add music
- Add sounds
- Help controller explaining the sytems
